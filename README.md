Guide to Accessing My Portfolio Website

1. Download Files:
To commence, download all the necessary files and save them in the designated directory: wamp64 -> www -> New Folder. This path is pertinent to Wamp Server, as mentioned earlier.

2. Launch Server Software:
Next, initiate the XAMPP or Wamp Server application on your computer. In the case of Wamp Server, you can right-click on the Wamp icon located in the taskbar, then navigate to the phpMyAdmin option.

3. Create a Database:
Within the phpMyAdmin interface, establish a new database with the name 'contactform'.

4. Set Up Database Tables:
Inside the 'contactform' database, proceed to create two distinct tables:

    Contact Form Table (contactform): Design this table with columns for name, email, and message.
    Registration Table (registration): Structure this table with columns including id, name, email, and message.

5. Access Your Website:
To view my portfolio website, open your preferred web browser and input the following URL in the address bar: http://localhost/your-folder-name/Untitled-1.php. Replace your-folder-name with the name of the folder where you have stored your portfolio files. Upon accessing this URL, my portfolio webpage will be displayed. Should you wish to explore the login and registration forms, simply click on the "Login" button situated on my portfolio webpage.

By meticulously following these steps, you will successfully open and explore your portfolio website using the Wamp Server environment.
